### Powerboard Activity 

#### Step X: Assign footprints
* Resistors: Resistor_SMD:R_0805_2012MetricPad1.15x1.40mm_HandSolder
* Capacitors: 

#### Step X: Create a .kicad_pcb file to layout the board 

* Open up the project file (.pro) and select the "PCB Layout Editor" button. KiCAD will ask you to confirm that you want to create a new .kicad_pcb file.

#### Step X: Change the board to be a **four layer** board. 

By convention, when referring to the number of layers in a PCB, we refer to the number of copper layers. 
* Go to "File" -> "Board Setup" 
* Set the number of "Copper Layers" to 4, as shown below. Notice that In1.Cu and In2.Cu (short for "Inner Layer") are added to the list of layers.  
* Set In1.Cu and B.Cu to be a "power plane", as shown below.
